# pytorch
deep learning with pytorch

## 1. Cơ bản
- Tensor và Gradient
- Gradient descent và Linear Regression 

## 2. Model pytorch 101
- Mnist (classifier)
- Boston housing (regression)

## 3. Train on 'cpu' or 'gpu'
- Mnist on device

## 4. Training on folder local, CNN basic
- Load image CIFAR10 on folder and train by model CNN

## 5. Data augmentation, regularization & resnet model
- Load image from local foder
- Nomalization, Augmentation
- Resnet model
- Learning rate schedule [document pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate)
- Gradient clip
- Weight decay (regularization)
- Train on device cpu or gpu
- Analyst error

## 6. Tranfer learning
- Fix analyst error compare with ##5
